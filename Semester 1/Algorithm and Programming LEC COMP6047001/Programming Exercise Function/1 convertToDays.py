"""
1. Write a function called convert to days() that takes no parameters. Have your function prompt the user to input numbers of hours, minutes, and seconds. 
Write a helper function called get days() that uses these values and converts them to days in float form (fractions of a day are allowed). get days() should return the number of days. Use this helper function within the convert to days() function to display the numbers of days to the user.
The built-in function round() takes two arguments: a number and an integer indicating the desired precision (i.e., the desired number of digits beyond the decimal point). Use this function to round the number of days four digits after the decimal point.

The following demonstrates the proper behavior of convert to days():
convert_to_days()
Enter number of hours   : 97
Enter number of minutes : 54
Enter number of seconds : 45
The number of days is   : 4.0797

def convert_to_days():
    h = int(input("Enter number of hours: "))
    m = int(input("Enter number of minutes: "))
    s = int(input("Enter number of seconds: "))
    def get_days():
        min = s / 60                #converting seconds to minutes

        hr = minutes / 60           #converting minutes to hours
        hours = h + hr              #total hours
        days =  hours / 24          #converting hours to days
        return round(days, 4)        #rounding the number of days to four decimal places
    print(f"The number of days is: {get_days()}")
