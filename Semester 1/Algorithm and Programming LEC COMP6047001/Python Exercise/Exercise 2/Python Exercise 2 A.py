Suppose you need push a cart on a ramp as shown in the figure below.

Ignoring friction, the force (in Newtons) required to push the cart mass (in kilograms) up a ramp
of angle θ (in degrees) is determined by the formula:

F = m × g × sinθ

Where g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant 9.8 m/s2.

Given this information, write a program that prompts the user to enter the Force and mass of
the cart. (Store the value of g as a ‘constant’ in your program) The program should then use the
formula to calculate the angle of the ramp. Format your output to 1 decimal place.

Note: The trigonometric functions in the math module returns the values in radians. In addition
to the arc sin function (asin), you will need to use the degrees function to convert the angle to
degrees.

Sample output:
Enter the mass of the cart (in kg)      : 100
Enter the force to push the cart (in N) : 250
The angle of the ramp is                : 14.8 degrees
